Description
------------

A simple stock management system for ebay traders or the like.


Important Information
---------------------

This is software written by me as practice and is not guaranteed to be error free, however it may be of use as a starting point for your own project and/or adapted to suit your own needs.

The files need to be hosted on a webserver running php (ideally locally, if you intend to host on the web you will need to develop a log-in system, as this is not yet complete). On the initial visit to index.php a sqlite database will be created, please ensure you have the correct directory/folder permissions to allow this to happen. The interface should be self explanatory from there, the only page you need to navigate to manually is index.php.

The system is currently designed for the UK and has UK postage rates.
