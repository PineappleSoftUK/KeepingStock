# Keeping Stock

## Update
Just a note to say I am currently learning/perfecting a REST API system and I intend to change KeepingStock over to this once I am happy with my test case. In the meantime there will not be any further updates.

Description
------------

A simple stock management system for ebay traders or the like.


Important Information
---------------------

This is software written by me as practice and is not guaranteed to be error free, however it may be of use as a starting point for your own project and/or adapted to suit your own needs.

The files need to be hosted on a webserver running php along with sqlite3. I directory api/config will be the default location for the sqlite3 database file thus will need write permissions.

Before first run please change the url from 'localhost' to a location appropriate to your setup in the following files:

api/config/core.php
app/global.js
