# Keeping Stock

A RESTful web application that keeps track of products/stock. Useful for sole traders or as inspiration to develop further. As it stands the system is still basic, users can register and login then products and categories can be added and managed, styling is currently focused on mobile devices, but everything still works on desktop. With time I hope to expand this software further.

Please see the wiki for installation instructions. Please note this software will need to be hosted on a webserver (local or remote) that has php and sqlite3 installed, javascript must be enabled client-side for the software to function.

Current progress
----------------

The files currently in the main branch form working software and will become version 2 once tested. The latest 'release' is actually the former system prior to switching to REST.

As mentioned the software works but is basic, I would like to add more functionality with time, but I do have one or two other projects that I will be starting soon.

Additional Information

This is software written by me as practice and is not guaranteed to be error free, however it may be of use as a starting point for your own project and/or adapted to suit your own needs.
